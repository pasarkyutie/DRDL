<h1 align=center><u>Hermit Mountain</u></h1>
<p><p style="font-size:25">There is an influx of domestic tourists in the highlands of Barangay Bi-ao, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental.
Mount Hermit is just along the road, which is perfect for tourists because you don’t need to be a hiker to get the fantastic view.
How to get there? From Bacolod, head on to the Municipality of Binalbagan and take the route of Binalbagan-Isabela Road. About 4 kilometers in the distance, go straight and look for the signage of Brgy. Payao, turn right and go straight ahead until you see the “Nasanagan Resort signage” and turn left.</p>
