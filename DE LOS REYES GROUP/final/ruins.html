<h1 align=center><u>The Ruins</u></h1>
<p><p style="font-size:25">The Ruins is one of the most beautiful tourist spots in Negros Occidental. Itâ€™s the remains of once a grand mansion built by Don Mariano Lacson for his unending love of his wife, Maria Braga after her death. This is the reason why it is known as the Taj Mahal of the Philippines. It was burned down by the United States Armed Forces in the Far East when the World War II broke out since rumors has it that Japanese forces might use it as headquarters. The building is still amazing and was made of Italianate architecture with neo-Romanesque twin columns. Outside the mansion is a fountain with a beautiful garden.
The Ruins is located in Talisay City, Negros Occidental.</p>
