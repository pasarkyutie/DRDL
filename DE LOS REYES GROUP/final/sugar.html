<h1 align=center><u>Sugar Beach</u></h1>
<p><p style="font-size:25">Sugar Beach is a popular yet not so crowded and quiet beach in Negros Occidental. It is probably called “Sugar Beach” since the sand is sugar brown and creamy, very soothing to the feet. This is actually one of the natural gems of the province where locals and tourists love to visit. There are many good resorts and restaurants nearby. One can relax in a hammock or enjoy kayaking. One can also enjoy swimming in the calm sea, snorkeling and exploring the sunken cargo ship nearby. If your budget and time allow, go scuba diving in the near dive sites teeming with marine lifeforms.
Sugar Beach is located in Sipalay, Negros Occidental.</p>
